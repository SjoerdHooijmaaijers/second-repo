<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>For this assignment, I have chosen to pick previous assignments from the course Generational Economics. Fearing that only one may have been too short, I will include the first and the second (out of a total of 6) assignment of this course. Both have mathematical derivations, but perhaps lack a few words.</p>
<h1 id="generational-economics-assignment-1">Generational Economics Assignment 1</h1>
<p>Assume that production is described by <span class="math inline">\(Y=AK^a L^b\)</span>, A, a and b are positive constants</p>
<h2 id="question-1">Question 1</h2>
<h3 id="i.-is-this-production-function-neoclassical-which-of-the-neoclassical-conditions-does-it-satisfy-and-which-ones-not" class="unnumbered"> i. Is this production function neoclassical? Which of the neoclassical conditions does it satisfy and which ones not?</h3>
<p>There are three conditions for a neoclassical function.<br />
Condition 1: Constant returns to scale<br />
<span class="math inline">\( \lambda Y = F(\lambda K,\lambda L)\)</span><br />
<span class="math inline">\( \lambda Y = A*\lambda K^a*\lambda L^b\)</span><br />
<span class="math inline">\( \lambda Y = A*\lambda ^{a+b}* K^a* L^b\)</span><br />
<span class="math inline">\( \lambda Y = \lambda ^{a+b}F(\lambda K,\lambda L)\)</span><br />
Thus, a+b=1<br />
And similarly; b=1-a<br />
Since a and b are positive constants, we know that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(0&lt;a&lt;1\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(0&lt;b&lt;1\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Condition 2: Positive but diminishing returns</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\delta F}{\delta K} = aAK^{a-1}L^{1-a} &gt; 0\]</span><br />
<span class="math display">\[\frac{\delta ^2 F}{\delta K^2} = (a-1)aAK^{a-2}L^{1-a} &lt; 0\]</span><br />
<span class="math display">\[\frac{\delta F}{\delta L} = aAK^{a}L^{-a} &gt; 0\]</span><br />
<span class="math display">\[\frac{\delta ^2 F}{\delta L^2} = -a(1-a)AK^{a}L^{-a-1} &lt; 0\]</span><br />
Condition 3. Inada conditions<br />
The marginal product of capital is<br />
<span class="math display">\[MPK = aAK^{a-1}L^{1-a}\]</span><br />
<span class="math display">\[= aA\frac{K}{L}^{a-1}\]</span><br />
and thus <span class="math display">\[\lim_{k\to\infty} aA \frac{K}{L}^{a-1} =0\]</span><br />
<span class="math display">\[\lim_{k\to 0} aA \frac{K}{L}^{a-1} = \infty\]</span><br />
<br />
The marginal product of labour is<br />
<span class="math display">\[MPL = (1-a)AK^{a}L^{-a}\]</span><br />
<span class="math display">\[= (1-a)A\frac{K}{L}^{a}\]</span><br />
and thus <span class="math display">\[\lim_{k\to\infty} (1-a)A \frac{K}{L}^{a} =0\]</span><br />
<span class="math display">\[\lim_{k\to 0} (1-a)A \frac{K}{L}^{a} = \infty\]</span><br />
In conclusion, all three requirements are fulfilled</p>
<h3 id="ii.-write-output-per-labour-efficiency-unit-y-as-a-function-of-capital-per-labour-efficiency-unit-k.-what-is-the-marginal-product-of-k" class="unnumbered">ii. Write output per labour efficiency unit (y) as a function of capital per labour efficiency unit (k). What is the marginal product of k?</h3>
<p>Remember we can write the production function as<br />
<span class="math display">\[Y=AK^a L^{a-1}\]</span><br />
Then, taking per labour efficiency units<br />
<span class="math display">\[\frac{Y}{L}= A \frac{K}{L}^{a} \frac{L}{L}^{a-1}\]</span><br />
Or in other terms<br />
<span class="math display">\[y=Ak^a\]</span><br />
Then the marginal product of k is:<br />
<span class="math display">\[f(k)=Ak^a\]</span><br />
<span class="math display">\[f&#39;(k)=aAk^{a-1}\]</span><br />

Assume that an economy is in a dynamically inefficient steady state when the rate of population growth n rises to a permanently higher level. Assume that investment per labour efficiency unit i does not change and that the capital-labour ratio converges to a new steady-state level. Will utility in the long run increase or decrease? Explain your answer!</h3>
<p>Taking that the economy starts off in a dynamically inefficient steady-state, it is located somewhere in the right hand side of the above graph.<br />
If the rate of population growth increases, and holding investment per labor efficiency unit constant, we can state, from the equation in <span class="math inline">\(i=(\delta+g)k\)</span>, that capital-labor ratio will decrease (intuitively, it makes sense considering that population now grows quicker – and so will labor – while, for capital, we see no difference); graphically, this means that the steady-state will now be represented further to the left.<br />
Given this, in the long-run, utility will increase as consumption increases, as the economy approaches its optimal capital-labor ratio.<br />
However, it is important to denote that if the decrease in k is large enough, it could also lead to the Golden Rule capital-labor ratio being surpassed, which would lead to a less-than-optimal utility.<br />
